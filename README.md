# Front End Web Application Portfolio

This project contains every front-end application I have made for the FreeCodeCamp online web community. This package
was designed so that a local instance or a cloud instance of my work may be viewable outside of CodePen.io (project link
[here](http://codepen.io/synflyn28/)). This project is also designed to work with continuous integration tools and all
dependencies are handled through Node.js and Bower.

## Installation and Running Steps

To run locally you must have the latest version of Node installed. Clone this repository and issue the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

After running ```npm start```, use a web browser and navigate to ```http://localhost:3000``` and the landing page should be
visible with a list of all project links.
